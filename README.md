Based on the 98_WKRCD4.pm

Added "Temp-Aussen-24h" and "Temp-Aussen-1h" readings, thanks to TORST3N for his Fork of 98_WKRCD4.pm ;o)

Changed "WW-Temp-Soll" to "Temp-WW-Soll", and add it to the "sets" section, now you get the actual value if you select "Temp-WW-Soll" in the set dialog. Also added the min and max limit for "Temp-WW-Soll" (30.0-55.0).
